		<text>I don't know what to say..Should I be happy or sad? I found out that I am the Shooter. A Shooter who lost his memory in one of the last passages leading to the center of the Zone. A Shooter who lost all of his friends except for the Doctor. A Shooter who found out something that made him be followed. What did I find out? Next question. The Doctor managed to save the key and the location of the secret stash of our group at Pripyat. It's located in one of the rooms of the old hotel in the center. He says that there must be something there that will shed some light on the "Granter of Wishes" or Monolith. He knows only one thing: after the second to last scouting expedition to the Cherbobyl NPP I kept on saying that there's something shady with Monolith. Well Monolith, we're going to try and deal with you. Who are you and what are you?</text>
